# pypassgen
PyPassGen is a simple command-line tool for generating secure random passwords of varying lengths. It's written in Python and uses the built-in secrets module to ensure high entropy and avoid common password patterns. Use it to create strong passwords for your online accounts, or integrate it into your own Python scripts and applications.
 
## Usage

To generate a password, run the `password_generator.py` script with the desired length as an argument. For example:

```
python password_generator.py 12
```

This will generate a random password with 12 characters.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3.5 or later.
